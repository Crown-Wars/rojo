rojo:
- json model properties prevent re-ordering
- project nodes should store sub syncback context
- sync back properties to project nodes
- convert concerning traces to info/warn/error
- convert "can't sync, skipping" traces to info/warn/error
- delete extra traces
- prevent overwriting toml/json with lua
- ignore globs to prevent syncback under
- ensure default properties are filtered out of meta files
- explore storing refs so ref properties work between files
- explore round-trip diff minim
- explore ref-matching to minimize ref property-caused diffs
- disallow bad filenames
- workaround bad filenames with init.meta
- better syncback inference
  - configuration as folder w/ init meta
  - *value as model json (or folder w/ init meta)
  - configuration as model json
  - attribute-informed middleware choice
  - sounds as model json
- standardize around "middleware" name
- add "transformer" support (rename to middleware)
  - req. pulling globs from state instead of static
- ensure instancecontext is chosen and passed around correctly
- convert project special-casing to new children mode enum

adopt me:
- figure out which folders should be synced in as models and which should be synced in as directories
- explore git performance with 6k+ files
