test:
- make sure instances that are newly referred to by a property are marked as changed (to ensure ref gets saved)
- disallow bad filenames
- prevent overwriting toml/json with lua
- add "transformer" support (rename to middleware)
  - req. pulling globs from state instead of static
- better syncback inference
  - configuration as folder w/ init meta
  - configuration as model json
  - sounds as model json
  - lighting objects as model json

wip:

next up:
- fixing unique ids does not work for binary; need to generate a value instead of delete entirely (or is rbx_binary just outdated?)
- figure out if internal diff is resulting in too many changes -> too many updates
- support SharedString in json

prod merge todo:
- clean up between-tree cloning behavior (duplicates with upstream, minus ref-keeping changes)
- rewrite refs instead of keeping refs

todo:
- json model preserve order
- convert concerning traces to info/warn/error
- convert "can't sync, skipping" traces to info/warn/error
- delete extra traces
- workaround bad filenames with init.meta
- better syncback inference
  - *value as model json (or folder w/ init meta)
  - attribute-informed middleware choice
  - for some model json objects, prefer directory w/ init.meta.json if they have children
- standardize around "middleware" name (fix refs to snapshot, syncback, and provider)
- ensure instancecontext is chosen and passed around correctly
- convert project special-casing to new children mode enum

adopt me:
- figure out which folders should be synced in as models and which should be synced in as directories
- explore git performance with 6k+ files

maybe done:
- disallow project updates from deleting files if referred to by path
- ensure default properties are filtered out of meta files
- explore storing refs so ref properties work between files
- explore round-trip diff minim
- explore ref-matching to minimize ref property-caused diffs

done:
- "--inspect-diff" argument that prints diff for specific path in tree, incl. properties
- "preferred ref" support to keep refs across files
- keep-ref: replace ref in snapshot incl. ref properties if already used in tree
- support user-defined property ignores for diff
- ignore globs to prevent syncback under
- project nodes should store sub syncback context
- sync back properties to project nodes

- meta file preserve order
- project file preserve order
