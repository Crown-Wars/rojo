This is a fork of Rojo with changes specific to the workflow at Uplift Games.

Changes from upstream Rojo:
* TOML support
* Ability to define the type of a file using glob patterns
* Font property support
* Model Scale property support
* Adds Font and Gui Inset migrations
* MeshPart support
* UniqueId support

## Syncback Experimental Branch

This branch additionally contains experimental `syncback` and `diff` commands, implementing **file-based two-way sync** and tree diffing.

Known issues:
- The code is messy! This was hacked away at constantly with little cleanup.
- Diffing can take a while on large projects
- The diff display displays some changes which are intentionally never
  committed. For example, it displays all extra services in the place file.
- ~~Localization files nearly always show up in diffs. Their contents are actually
  just a json string, and they'll be "different" even if the json decodes to the
  same. Additionally, Roblox's json output is not deterministic.~~\
  This is mostly fixed now â€” we reserialize the localization table json
  deterministically before diffing.
- Absolutely zero tests for all of this new functionality
- Other things I'm almost certainly forgetting!

How to:
1. Prepare your project for assets by adding folders and project file entries for common asset locations like Workspace and ReplicatedStorage
2. Save your place file somewhere accessible
3. Syncback: `rojo syncback --input path/to/your/place.rbxl path/to/your/project_name.project.json`
4. Confirm that the diff looks right and it will write the assets to the filesystem

Exciting features list:
- Can turn any instance into an item on the filesystem
- Chooses filesystem representation intelligently based on instance class,
  properties, etc.
- Prefers to keep existing filesystem representation if possible
- Only syncs changed instances to minimize git diffs
- Built-in filters for problematic properties, plus the ability to define your own
- Blob exclusion lists for places that shouldn't be sync back into (e.g. code directories)
- Ability to sync from a project to another project

New `project.json` fields:

```jsonc
{
    "syncback": { // optional
        "excludeGlobs": ["glob/paths/here"], // optional
        "skipInstanceNames": [               // optional
            // skip every instance with one of these names

            // These instances practically become invisible to all syncback operations except
            // serialization of their ancestors. They will not trigger diff changes and they
            // will not be saved as their own file on the filesystem.
            "InstanceName"
        ],
        "propertyDefaults": {                // optional
            "PropertyName": { "Float32": 0.0 } // skip this property in all circumstances when it's this default value
        },
        "propertyFilters": {                 // optional
            "PropertyNameSample1": {
                "diff": "always", // optional, default
                "save": "always", // optional, default
                // diff controls whether a property can trigger a change.
                // save controls whether a property appears in json models and meta files.
            },
            "PropertyNameSample2": {
                "diff": "never", // never [diff/save] this property
                "save": {
                    "whenNotEqual": [ // skip this property if it equals any of these values
                        { "Float32": 0.0 }, // exact comparison is done, so typically for
                        { "Float64": 0.0 }, // numbers you should define all numerical types
                        { "Int32": 0 },
                        { "Int64": 0 }, // see https://rojo.space/docs/v7/properties for more fully qualified property samples
                    ]
                }
            },
        }
    }
}
```

```jsonc
{
    "snapshotRules": [ // optional
        // custom glob rules for what type of instance files should be turn into.
        {
            "use": "rojo/txt",      // required
            "include": ["*.txt"],   // required
            "exclude": ["docs/**"], // optional
        }
        // full list of types:
        //  "rojo/lua", "rojo/txt", "rojo/csv", "rojo/json", "rojo/toml",
        //  "rojo/json_model", "rojo/rbxm", "rojo/rbxmx",
        //  "rojo/project", "rojo/directory",
        // (project and directory are not really intended for external use, but they may work fine)
    ]
}
```

<details><summary>Release Instructions</summary>

New Uplift Games-specific releases should:
* Be created via [workflow dispatch on the Release action](https://github.com/UpliftGames/rojo/actions/workflows/release.yml)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1669436/233771073-ccbd1834-3341-4aeb-91cd-be7b02878b39.png)
  * Be created on the `uplift` branch _(this is our `main`)_
  * Be tagged with an appropriate semver **plus** a pre-release tag in the following format:\
    `v1.2.3-uplift.1`\
    ...where `v1.2.3` is the semver and `uplift.1` increments for each release we make.
    It is acceptable to maintain the release count across semver changes.
  * Once the release action finishes there will be a release draft. Add a changelog and publish it.
    If any release job fails due to aftman github limits, re-run failed jobs.
* Add our changes to `CHANGELOG.md`. If we rebase on a
  new version of Rojo that includes some of our additions, we should list only
  what has changed between upstream Rojo and our fork.
* Where possible, our changes should become PRs to the upstream Rojo repo. When
  we do this, we should include a link to the PR in the changelog entry.
